LOGIN TESTS
	= redirect test (on 204 response from the service) - it does not care about username/password
	= unsuccesful - check if login adds error text to scope ('OH THE SHAME!!!') if 401 or 404 is returned

I cannot test the actual username/password combinations!
We will have to mock out the response from the service

FRIENDS CONTROLLER
- Get list of friends when controller loads
	= to return correct url
	= test, that scope variable is set with a list of friends
- Add friend
	= if f==null then do not call service
	= if f is valid(string) add to list, call the service with correct name
